This program filters aircraft data from a CSV file by class, weight and SRS.

This program was made for a friend to assist them with their course work.

I produced this in a massive rush and is by no means designed with thourough fore-thought or propper planning. 

This serves as an example of how a lack of planning leads to hard to maintain code.
It would likely have taken less time to plan out a design and develop the code rather than rush into coding blindly.
